## Installation
To install the website on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Issues
Challenges Encountered:
1. **CSS Responsiveness**: Initially, multiple CSS files led to small inconsistent responsiveness across different pages.
2. **HTML Validation**: Encountered a W3C validation error related to the `charset` attribute placement.
   - Error: "A charset attribute on a meta element found after the first 1024 bytes."
   - Context: The error occurs in `Member.html`. Removing content from lines 33 to 67 resolves the issue, but this section is retained for aesthetic appeal until a solution is found.

3. **Design Consistency**: The navigation bar experiences alignment issues on smaller screens.

## Validation
- CSS validation is successful across all pages.
